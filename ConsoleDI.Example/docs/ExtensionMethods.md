For a C# application when should an extension method be used and can you provide a list of tutorials regarding extensions and best practices for using extension methods?

Certainly! **Extension methods** in C# allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type. Here are some key points about extension methods:

1. **Usage and Basics**:
   - Extension methods are static methods but are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.
   - They're commonly used for LINQ query operators, which enhance `IEnumerable<T>` types.
   - To use standard query operators, import them with `using System.Linq`.
   - Example: Calling `OrderBy` on an array of integers:
     ```csharp
     int[] ints = { 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 };
     var result = ints.OrderBy(g => g);
     // Output: 10 15 21 26 39 45
     ```

2. **Best Practices**:
   - **Read the .NET Framework Class Library Design Guidelines** to understand conventions.
   - **Be wary of extension methods**: Use them judiciously; don't overextend types you don't own.
   - **Put extension methods into their own namespace** for clarity.
   - **Prefer interface extensions over class extensions** to avoid polluting unrelated types.
   - **Be specific with the types you extend** to prevent unintended usage.
   - **Ignore advice where it's not appropriate** (context matters).
