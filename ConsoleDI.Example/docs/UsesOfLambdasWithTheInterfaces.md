Can you explain this syntax and how the lambda expression is working in detail?  ServiceLifetime IReportServiceLifetime.Lifetime => ServiceLifetime.Scoped;

Certainly! Let's dive into the details of the lambda expression in the provided code snippet:

1. **Lambda Expressions**:
   - A lambda expression is an anonymous function that allows you to create concise code.
   - It's not bound to an identifier (i.e., it doesn't have a name).
   - The lambda declaration operator `=>` separates the parameter list from the body of the lambda expression.

2. **Syntax**:
   - The syntax for a lambda expression can take two forms:
     - **Expression Lambda** (with an expression as its body):
       ```csharp
       (input-parameters) => expression
       ```
     - **Statement Lambda** (with a statement block as its body):
       ```csharp
       (input-parameters) => { /* sequence of statements */ }
       ```

3. **Your Example**:
   - The code snippet you provided:
     ```csharp
     ServiceLifetime IReportServiceLifetime.Lifetime => ServiceLifetime.Scoped;
     ```
   - This is an expression lambda.
   - It defines a property called `Lifetime` for an interface (`IReportServiceLifetime`).
   - The expression on the right side of `=>` specifies the value of the property, which is `ServiceLifetime.Scoped`.

4. **Explanation**:
   - The lambda expression `(input-parameters) => expression`:
     - In your case, there are no input parameters (empty parentheses).
     - The expression is `ServiceLifetime.Scoped`.
     - This means that whenever you access the `Lifetime` property of an instance implementing `IReportServiceLifetime`, it will return `ServiceLifetime.Scoped`.

5. **Delegate Types**:
   - Lambda expressions can be converted to delegate types.
   - The parameters and return value of the lambda determine the delegate type.
   - In your example, the lambda expression can be converted to a delegate with the signature `Func<ServiceLifetime>`.

6. **Use Cases**:
   - Lambda expressions are commonly used in LINQ queries, asynchronous methods, and other scenarios where you need to pass behavior as an argument.
   - For instance, in LINQ, you can use a lambda expression to define the projection or filtering logic.

For C# lambda expressions with only one parameter is that why parenthesis are not required?

Certainly! In C#, if a lambda expression has **exactly one parameter** and the compiler can infer its type, you can omit the parentheses. Here's an example:

```csharp
Func<double, double> cube = x => x * x * x;
```

In this case, the lambda expression `(x) => x * x * x` can be simplified to `x => x * x * x`. The parentheses are optional when there's only one parameterÂ²Â³.
