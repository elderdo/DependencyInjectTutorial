Certainly! Let's break down the code snippet:

1. **Namespace and Using Statement:**
   - The code begins with a `using` statement that imports the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` namespace. This namespace provides classes and interfaces for implementing dependency injection (DI) in .NET applications.

2. **Namespace Declaration:**
   - The snippet then defines a namespace called `ConsoleDI.Example`. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and prevent naming conflicts.
   - Note that the semicolon at the end of the namespace declaration is incorrect; it should be removed.

3. **Interface Definition:**
   - The snippet declares an interface named `IExampleScopedService`.
   - This interface inherits from another interface called `IReportServiceLifetime`.
   - The `IExampleScopedService` interface represents a service that has a scoped lifetime (more on that below).

4. **Lifetime Definition:**
   - The `ServiceLifetime IReportServiceLifetime.Lifetime => ServiceLifetime.Scoped;` line defines the lifetime of the service.
   - In this case, the service lifetime is set to `ServiceLifetime.Scoped`.
   - Scoped lifetime means that an instance of the service is created once per scope (usually per HTTP request in web applications).
   - When the scope ends (e.g., at the end of an HTTP request), the service instance is disposed of.

5. **Summary:**
   - In summary, this code defines an interface (`IExampleScopedService`) that represents a scoped service. Scoped services are created once per scope and are useful for scenarios where you want to share state within a specific context (such as an HTTP request).

If you're working with dependency injection (DI) in .NET, understanding service lifetimes (transient, scoped, and singleton) is crucial. Scoped services are commonly used in web applications to manage per-request state. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions! üòäüëç
