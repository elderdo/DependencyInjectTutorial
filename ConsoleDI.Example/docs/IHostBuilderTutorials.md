Is there a youtube C# tutorial that covers the use of the Microsoft class that implements the interface IHostBuilder and how to use it well?

Certainly! The **IHostBuilder** is a crucial component in ASP.NET Core applications, allowing you to configure and build the application's host. Let me provide you with some resources that cover its usage:

1. **YouTube Video: "CreateDefaultBuilder and ConfigureWebHostDefaults"**
   - This video discusses the **GenericHost** concept in ASP.NET Core 3/5. It explains how an **IHostBuilder** is created and configured, along with methods for fine-tuning the configuration.
   - [Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwGoBXZYbKI) ‚Å¥.

2. **Blog Post: "Using HostBuilder and the Generic Host in .NET Core Microservices"**
   - This blog post explores an example of using the new generic **Host** and **HostBuilder** available in .NET Core 2.1. It demonstrates building a simple console-based, cloud-native microservice.
   - [Read the blog post](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/using-generic-host-in-dotnet-core-console-based-microservices) ‚Åµ.

3. **GitHub Sample: "Sample console app to show how to use the `IHostBuilder`"**
   - If you prefer code examples, check out this GitHub repository. It provides a sample console app demonstrating how to use the **IHostBuilder** in a .NET Core console application.

Remember to explore these resources to gain a deeper understanding of **IHostBuilder** and its role in ASP.NET Core applications. Happy learning! üòä
