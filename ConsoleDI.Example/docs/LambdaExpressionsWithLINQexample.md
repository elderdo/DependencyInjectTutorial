For this C# code snippet can you break down this LINQ lambda expression and explain in detail how it works? i

```csharp
nt[] ints = { 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 };
     var result = ints.OrderBy(g => g);
```

Certainly! Let's break down the LINQ lambda expression in your code snippet:

1. **The Code**:
   ```csharp
   int[] ints = { 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 };
   var result = ints.OrderBy(g => g);
   ```

2. **Explanation**:
   - `ints` is an array of integers containing the values `{ 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 }`.
   - The `OrderBy` method is a LINQ extension method that sorts the elements of a sequence in ascending order based on a specified key.
   - The lambda expression `g => g` is the key selector. Let's break it down further:
     - `(g => g)` defines an anonymous function (lambda) that takes a single parameter `g`.
     - The expression `g => g` simply returns the value of `g` itself (identity function).
     - In other words, it sorts the array elements based on their natural order (ascending).

3. **Result**:
   - After executing `OrderBy`, the `result` variable will contain an ordered sequence of integers: `{ 10, 15, 21, 26, 39, 45 }`.

In summary, the lambda expression `g => g` ensures that the array elements are sorted in ascending order. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions! ðŸ˜Š
